# ECE_257B HW0

File Description:

OFDM_TX.m - This file contains the transmitter end code. You need to have a look at this to understand the parameters, preamble, pilots, and data generation.

mapping.m & demapper.m - These are helper files used for FEC and modulation/ demodulation

MyOfdmReceiver.m - This file contains some basic code for receiver design and lists the blocks for which you need to write the code stubs. Some hints are provided in comments on how to implement these blocks. More will be added in the next few days.

OFDM_test.m is code to test your receiver ideally with simulation you should achieve 0 BER
